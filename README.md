Step 1: First, you need to clone the repository in Visual Studio Code.(I am telling Visual Studio Code as I have done the coding on Pycharm. If you know how to clone it on other platforms, then you can clone it in other platforms.)
Step 2: Run python main.py in SQLITE explorer in Visual Studio Code.
Step 3:Login by using Username: admin, Password: admin and the category as admin also.
Now you can use the app on your own.
